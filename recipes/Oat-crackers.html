     <h1>Delicious and healthy oat crackers</h1>
     <p>These crackers are a healthy and tasty treat that is easy to make. Done in about 40 mins with just a few ingredients.</p>
    <ul>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>
    <li>1 and 3/4 cups rolled oats.</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups of water</li>
    <li>1/2 cups of the nuts of your choice (almonds work great!)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  </h3>
</ul>
   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
    <h3>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Spray a large rimmed baking sheet (I used an 18x13 inch half sheet pan) with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
    <li>In a blender, process the oats, water, nuts or seeds, baking powder, and optional salt until completley smooth. Scrape down the sides of the container and blend again.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread with a spatula into an even layer (lift and tilt the pan for even and complete coverage).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven; using a knife or pastry scraper, cut the crackers into small squares (I cut into 12x9 rows, 108 crackers).</li>
    <li>Return the cut crackers to the oven and bake for another 30 to 35 minutes until light golden brown and crispy (they will look dry, and also feel firm to the touch).</li>
    <li>Remove all the crackers that look done. If any crackers (towards the middle) need additional baking, keep them on the baking sheet and return to the oven for several more minutes until the crackers are crisp.</li>
    <li>Completely cool the crackers on a cooling rack.
